            <h2>About Me:</h2>

            <p>I'm not very good at talking about myself, but I'm Hannah, a junior in med. I like drawing, roguelike and rhythm games, and reading.</p>

            <p>I don't know if the following information means anything, but people ask me about this stuff a lot so I figured I might as well put it here:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Birthday: October 30th, 2006</li>
                <li>Star-Sign: Scorpio ‚ôè (I think this means I'm supposed to be cool and confident, so that's definitely a lie.)</li>
                <li>MBTI: ISTP (Legitimately have no idea what this means, but I took the test once and that's what I got)</li>
            </ul>
